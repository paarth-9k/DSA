This C++ code is a solution to the Leetcode problem **"Count Good Numbers"**.

### üß† Problem Summary (Leetcode 1922 - Count Good Numbers):

You are given a number `n`. You have to count how many "good numbers" of length `n` can be formed.

A **"good number"** of length `n` is defined such that:

* At **even indices** (0-based), the digit is **even** (i.e., one of `0, 2, 4, 6, 8` ‚Üí 5 choices)
* At **odd indices**, the digit is **prime** (i.e., one of `2, 3, 5, 7` ‚Üí 4 choices)

Return the total number of such good numbers modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### üîç Code Breakdown

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    const int M = 1e9 + 7; // modulus value to avoid large numbers
```

* `M` is the modulo value: 10^9 + 7, a common large prime to keep results manageable.

#### üîÅ Modular Exponentiation Function

```cpp
    long long pow(long long x, long long y) {
        if (y == 0)
            return 1;
        long long half = pow(x, y / 2);
        long long result = (half * half) % M;
        if (y % 2)
            result = (result * x) % M;
        return result;
    }
```

* Efficiently calculates `(x^y) % M` using **binary exponentiation** (aka fast exponentiation).
* Recursively halves the exponent to reduce time complexity from **O(y)** to **O(log y)**.

#### ‚úÖ Main Function

```cpp
    int countGoodNumbers(long long n) {
        return (pow(5, (n + 1) / 2) * pow(4, (n) / 2)) % M;
    }
};
```

* `(n + 1) / 2` gives the number of **even positions** (because they come first: index 0, 2, 4...).
* `n / 2` gives the number of **odd positions** (index 1, 3, 5...).

So, total good numbers =
**(5 choices for even positions)^(number of even positions)** √ó
**(4 choices for odd positions)^(number of odd positions)**

---

### ‚úÖ Example

If `n = 4`, the positions are:

| Index | Allowed Digits               |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 0     | Even ‚Üí 5 choices (0,2,4,6,8) |
| 1     | Prime ‚Üí 4 choices (2,3,5,7)  |
| 2     | Even ‚Üí 5 choices             |
| 3     | Prime ‚Üí 4 choices            |

So total = `5^2 * 4^2 = 25 * 16 = 400`

This is exactly what the code calculates.

### üí° Summary

The code uses:

* **Modular exponentiation** to efficiently compute large powers
* Smart indexing based on position parity
* Combines counts with modulo to avoid overflow
