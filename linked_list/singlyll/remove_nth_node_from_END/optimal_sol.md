Sure! Letâ€™s break down your C++ code for the function `removeNthFromEnd`, which **removes the nth node from the end** of a singly linked list.

---

### âœ… Problem

Given a linked list, remove the **nth node from the end** and return the head of the updated list.

---

### âœ… Code Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
```

This function takes the `head` of the list and an integer `n`, and it returns the updated `head` after deleting the nth node from the end.

---

### âœ… Step-by-Step Logic

#### 1. **Base Case Check**

```cpp
        if (head == nullptr)
            return head;
```

If the list is empty (i.e., `head` is `nullptr`), return it immediately.

---

#### 2. **Two Pointers (fast and slow)**

```cpp
        ListNode *fast = head, *slow;
```

Initialize two pointers.

* `fast` will move `n` steps ahead
* `slow` will later point to the node before the one we want to remove.

---

#### 3. **Advance `fast` by `n` nodes**

```cpp
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }
```

* Moves the `fast` pointer `n` steps forward.
* So now, the distance between `fast` and the `slow` (which we will soon set) is `n`.

---

#### 4. **Edge Case: Remove the Head Node**

```cpp
        slow = head;
        if(fast == NULL)
        {
            return head -> next;
        }
```

If `fast` becomes `NULL` after the loop, it means the list has **exactly `n` nodes** and we need to **remove the head node** (because it's the nth from the end).

So just return `head->next` (i.e., skip the head node).

---

#### 5. **Move `fast` and `slow` together**

```cpp
        while (fast->next != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
```

Keep moving both pointers one step at a time **until `fast` reaches the last node**.
After this loop:

* `slow` will be **right before** the node that needs to be deleted.
* `fast` will be at the end.

---

#### 6. **Remove the Target Node**

```cpp
        slow->next = slow->next->next;
```

This skips the target node (the nth node from end) by linking `slow`'s `next` to the node after the one to delete.

---

#### 7. **Return Updated List**

```cpp
        return head;
    }
};
```

Finally, return the original head (which may have changed in the edge case).

---

### âœ… Summary of Approach

* Use **two pointers** with a fixed `n` distance.
* Specially handle the case when we need to delete the **first node**.
* For all other cases, move both pointers together until `fast` reaches the end.
* Then delete the node after `slow`.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Example

Input: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `n = 2`

* After moving `fast` 2 steps: `fast = 3`, `slow = 1`
* After loop: `fast = 5`, `slow = 3`
* Remove `slow->next` â†’ 4 â†’ Result: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`
